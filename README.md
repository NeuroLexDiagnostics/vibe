The <strong>Vibe API</strong> is an all-purpose eye tracking API for Alzheimer's disease research.

This was made on behalf of the 2021 CNT Hackathon at the [UW Center for Neurotechnology](http://www.csne-erc.org/).

## Problem

- Alzheimer's disease affects > worldwide. 
- The diagnosis occurs frequently at late stages of the disease, when symptoms are evident. 
- AD is present up to 20 years before the disease is manifested. 
- Treatment is helpful to delay the progression and improve quality of life. 
- There is a strong need for early diagnosis to improve treatment outcomes. 
- [MMSE exam](http://www.fammed.usouthal.edu/Guides%26JobAids/Geriatric/MMSE.pdf) is the current gold standard to diagnose MCI and dementia; it takes >50 minutes and requires an expert, which limits the ubiquity of AD screening in the population
